# Beaneater

![Build Status](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beaneater/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)

A Ruby client for [beanstalkd](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd) and [Tuber](https://github.com/dkam/tuber), the simple and fast job queues. Tuber is a Rust rewrite of beanstalkd with extensions including weighted tubes, idempotent/unique jobs, concurrency controls and job dependencies.

## Quick Start

```ruby
@beanstalk = Beaneater.new('localhost:11300')

@tube = @beanstalk.tubes["my-tube"]
@tube.put '{"key": "foo"}', pri: 5
@tube.put '{"key": "bar"}', delay: 3

while @tube.peek(:ready)
  job = @tube.reserve
  puts job.body
  job.delete
end

@beanstalk.close
```

## Installation

Install beanstalkd or tuber, then add the gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'beaneater'
```

## Usage

### Configuration

To setup advanced options for beaneater, you can pass configuration options using:

```ruby
Beaneater.configure do |config|
  # config.default_put_delay   = 0
  # config.default_put_pri     = 65536
  # config.default_put_ttr     = 120
  # config.job_parser          = lambda { |body| body }
  # config.job_serializer      = lambda { |body| body }
  # config.beanstalkd_url      = 'localhost:11300'
  # config.connect_timeout     = nil
  # config.resolv_timeout      = nil
  # config.read_timeout        = nil
  # config.write_timeout       = nil
end
```

The above options are all defaults, so only include a configuration block if you need to make changes.

`connect_timeout` and `resolv_timeout` are passed through to `TCPSocket.new` on Ruby 3.0 and newer (ignored on Ruby < 3.0 for compatibility). `read_timeout` and `write_timeout` apply socket read and write timeouts via `setsockopt`.

### Connection

```ruby
@beanstalk = Beaneater.new('10.0.1.5:11300')

# Or use ENV['BEANSTALKD_URL']
@beanstalk = Beaneater.new

@beanstalk.close
```

### Tubes

Tubes are beanstalk's work queues. Jobs are `put` into the used tube and `reserve`d from watched tubes. Each tube has a _ready_, _delayed_, and _buried_ queue.

```ruby
@tube = @beanstalk.tubes.find("some-tube")

# Watch tubes for reserving jobs
@beanstalk.tubes.watch!('some-tube')        # watch only these tubes
@beanstalk.tubes.watch('another-tube')       # append to watch list
@beanstalk.tubes.ignore('some-tube')         # stop watching

# List tubes
@beanstalk.tubes.all       # => [<Tube name='foo'>, <Tube name='bar'>]
@beanstalk.tubes.used      # => <Tube name='bar'>
@beanstalk.tubes.watched   # => [<Tube name='foo'>]

# Manage tubes
@tube.pause(3)        # pause for 3 seconds
@tube.clear           # delete all jobs
@tube.flush           # delete all jobs, returns count
@tube.flush_buried    # delete only buried jobs (Tuber only), returns count
```

Each client manages two separate concerns: **use**/**using** controls where `put` places jobs, and **watch**/**watching** controls where `reserve` takes jobs from. These are fully orthogonal.

### Jobs

A job has a body (string) and metadata. The typical lifecycle:

```
   put            reserve               delete
  -----> [READY] ---------> [RESERVED] --------> *poof*
```

Jobs are in one of three states:

| State   | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ready   | Waiting to be reserved and processed. |
| delayed | Waiting to become ready after a delay. |
| buried  | Held aside after failure, waiting to be kicked. |

#### Inserting jobs

```ruby
@tube.put "job-data-here"
@tube.put({foo: 'bar'}.to_json)
@tube.put "job-data-here", pri: 1000, delay: 50, ttr: 200
```

- **pri** — integer < 2^32, lower values run first (default: 65536)
- **delay** — seconds to wait before the job becomes ready (default: 0)
- **ttr** — time to run, seconds a worker has to finish the job (default: 120)

#### Reserving and processing jobs

```ruby
job = @beanstalk.tubes.reserve      # blocks until a job is available
job = @beanstalk.tubes.reserve(5)   # wait up to 5 seconds

puts job.body
puts job.tube
puts job.stats.state  # => 'reserved'

job.touch    # extend ttr
job.delete   # success
job.release delay: 5  # retry later
job.bury     # set aside for inspection
```

#### Peeking and kicking

```ruby
@beanstalk.jobs.find(123)       # peek at a specific job
@tube.peek(:ready)              # peek at next ready job
@tube.peek(:buried)
@tube.peek(:delayed)

@beanstalk.tubes['some-tube'].kick(3)  # kick 3 buried jobs back to ready
```

#### Automatic processing

Register handlers for tubes and let `process!` loop over incoming jobs:

```ruby
@beanstalk.jobs.register('some-tube', retry_on: [SomeError]) do |job|
  do_something(job)
end

@beanstalk.jobs.register('other-tube') do |job|
  do_something_else(job)
end

@beanstalk.jobs.process!
```

The loop reserves a job, calls the matching handler, then: deletes on success, releases on `retry_on` errors, and buries on other exceptions. Raise `AbortProcessingError` to stop the loop.

### Job Dependencies (Tuber only)

When using [Tuber](https://github.com/dkam/tuber), you can group related jobs and chain dependent work using `group:` and `after:` options on `put`. After-jobs are held until every job in the group they depend on has been deleted:

```ruby
# Fan-out: enqueue grouped work
@tube.put "import-row-1", group: "import"
@tube.put "import-row-2", group: "import"

# Fan-in: this job waits until all "import" jobs are deleted
@tube.put "send-summary", after: "import"
```

Chain stages together by combining `after:` and `group:` on the same job to build a simple DAG pipeline:

```ruby
@tube.put "row-1", group: "extract"
@tube.put "row-2", group: "extract"
@tube.put "transform", after: "extract", group: "transform"
@tube.put "load",      after: "transform"
```

Here `transform` waits for the extract group to finish, then becomes part of the `transform` group. `load` waits for `transform` to complete.

Buried jobs block group completion — kick them to let the group finish. Group names are global and can span multiple tubes.

### Unique Jobs / Idempotency (Tuber only)

Prevent duplicate jobs with the `idempotency:` option. If a job with the same key already exists in the tube, the original job is returned instead of creating a duplicate:

```ruby
@tube.put "send-report", idempotency: "daily-report"
# => <Beaneater::Job id=1 body="send-report">

@tube.put "send-report", idempotency: "daily-report"
# => <Beaneater::Job id=1 body="send-report">  (same job, no duplicate created)
```

The key is scoped to the tube and cleared when the job is deleted, so the same key can be reused afterwards.

Add a cooldown TTL to keep deduplicating for N seconds after deletion — useful for preventing rapid resubmission:

```ruby
@tube.put "send-report", idempotency: "daily-report", idempotency_ttl: 300
```

### Concurrency Keys (Tuber only)

Limit parallel processing of related jobs. When a job with a concurrency key is reserved, other ready jobs sharing the same key are hidden from `reserve` until the reservation ends:

```ruby
# Only one job per user can be processed at a time
@tube.put "process-user-42", concurrency: "user-42"
@tube.put "process-user-42-again", concurrency: "user-42"
```

The second job won't be reserved until the first is deleted, released, or buried. Set a higher limit to allow N concurrent reservations:

```ruby
# Allow up to 3 concurrent API jobs
@tube.put "api-call-1", concurrency: "api", concurrency_limit: 3
@tube.put "api-call-2", concurrency: "api", concurrency_limit: 3
```

### Weighted Tubes (Tuber only)

By default, `reserve` picks the highest-priority job across all watched tubes. Switch to weighted mode to select tubes randomly in proportion to their weight:

```ruby
@beanstalk.tubes.watch('email')
@beanstalk.tubes.watch('notifications', weight: 2)
@beanstalk.tubes.watch('batch-jobs', weight: 6)

@beanstalk.tubes.reserve_mode(:weighted)

job = @beanstalk.tubes.reserve  # batch-jobs selected 6x as often as email
```

Tubes default to weight 1. Switch back with `reserve_mode(:fifo)`.

### Batch Reserve (Tuber only)

Reserve multiple jobs atomically in a single call:

```ruby
jobs = @beanstalk.tubes.reserve_batch(10)  # up to 10 jobs

jobs.each do |job|
  process(job)
  job.delete
end
```

By default `reserve_batch` is non-blocking — it returns whatever is ready
immediately, possibly an empty array. Pass a timeout (in seconds) to long-poll
instead: the call blocks until the first job arrives, then drains everything
ready up to `count`, or returns an empty array when the timeout elapses. This
avoids hot-looping a worker on empty polls.

```ruby
jobs = @beanstalk.tubes.reserve_batch(10, 30)  # block up to 30s for the first job
```

While blocked, a positive-timeout batch reserve may raise
`Beaneater::DeadlineSoonError` if one of the connection's already-reserved jobs
is about to hit its TTR — service that job, then reserve again.

### Batch Touch (Tuber 0.12.0+)

A batch reserve starts the TTR clock on every job at the same instant, but a
worker processes them serially — so the tail of a large batch can expire and
return to the queue while the worker is still busy. `touch_all` extends the TTR
of every job the connection currently holds in a single command:

```ruby
jobs = @beanstalk.tubes.reserve_batch(10)

jobs.each do |job|
  process(job)
  job.delete
  @beanstalk.jobs.touch_all   # heartbeat whatever is still held
end
```

No ids are sent: the server tracks the reserved set per connection, so jobs
already deleted, released, buried or lost to a TTR timeout are simply absent.
Each job keeps its own TTR — deadlines are extended individually, not levelled
onto a common value.

The return value is how many jobs the connection *actually* still holds. A count
lower than expected means jobs hit their TTR and went back to the queue while the
worker was busy — otherwise invisible, since nothing notifies a worker that it
lost a job.

### Stats

```ruby
@beanstalk.stats                            # server-wide stats
@beanstalk.tubes['some-tube'].stats         # tube stats
@beanstalk.jobs[some_job_id].stats          # job stats
```

## Configuration

```ruby
Beaneater.configure do |config|
  config.default_put_delay   = 0
  config.default_put_pri     = 65536
  config.default_put_ttr     = 120
  config.job_parser          = lambda { |body| body }
  config.job_serializer      = lambda { |body| body }
  config.beanstalkd_url      = 'localhost:11300'
end
```

The `job_serializer` is applied to every `put` body — useful for automatic JSON encoding:

```ruby
Beaneater.configure do |config|
  config.job_serializer = lambda { |body| JSON.dump(body) }
end
```

## Error Handling
